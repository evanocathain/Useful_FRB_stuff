This repository holds a collection of useful codes and scripts for
analysis of single pulse searches and FRB data from radio telescopes.

1. FAKE

Can use the following to replace the existing files in a standard
psrsoft (see http://www.pulsarastronomy.net/wiki/Software/PSRSoft)
installation of sigproc

   fake.c - conserves area under pulse + few other edits
   help.c - fake usage message updated

2. dDM_S.py

A python script to calculate the relative S/N for an incorrect DM

3. SP_search_comparison

Some scripts to generate comparison data and plots of 4 SP search codes

4. view_archival_FRBs

A script for grabbing FRBs from fil files and making output in useful
data formats for further analysis.

5. archival_FRB_data.link

The URL link to the public Google Drive directory for the raw data and
various different useful formats.

6. dedisp_steps

A code which outputs the DM steps from the algorithm of Levin 2011,
and as used by heimdall. It also outputs info. on the scalloped DM
response.

7. destroy_gutted.link

A link to a lightweight version of destroy, a SP search code.

8. sc_td_linux.link

A link to a github repository for a linux version of a code that
converts "scamp" data format (archival Parkes surveys, especially
those that used the analogue filterbanks) to sigproc "filterbank"
format.
