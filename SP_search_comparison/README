sp_searches.csh makes a fake filterbank file with a typical FRB pulse
in it, then searches it with 4 different SP search codes as a function
of boxcar phase. It does this for many different realisations.

look_at_output.csh takes the output from sp_searches.csh and
determines the average and rms deviations for each code for each
phase.

plot.gp plots the output from look_at_output.csh
