If you do:

./dedisp_steps 1.05 100 1 > tol_1.05
./dedisp_steps 1.01 100 1 > tol_1.01
gnuplot -persist scallop.plt

you will see the relative S/N versus DM for the first few DM
trials. The dmtol is defined by Levin (and used by Barsdell in
heimdall) so that the effective width at trial i+1 is dmtol times the
effective width at trial i (Levin, 2011, PhD thesis, Swinburne, p 31,
Eq 2.2). But note that:

1. S/N scales with the sqrt of the effective width

2. If you wanted dm trials spaced such that something 'between' trials
loses 100*(1 - 1/sqrt(dmtol)) percent S/N you should define the point
between 2 DM trials as that where weff_{i+1} = dmtol*wedd_{i}. As this
is actually defined by Levin to be value of the next trial the loss
due to the scalloped DM coverage is _much_ less severe (or, depending
on your point-of-view, heimdall performs too many DM trials). The loss
in S/N is actually just as given below:

dm_tol = 1.25
100*1/sqrt(1.25) = 89.4 % 
dm_step at DM 1000 is ~2.9
DM=1000 between-trial relative S/N is ~97%

dm_tol = 1.05
100*1/sqrt(1.05) = 97.5 % 
dm_step at DM 1000 is ~1.3
DM=1000 between-trial relative S/N is ~99.5%

dm_tol = 1.01
100*1/sqrt(1.01) = 99.5 % 
dm_step at DM 1000 is ~0.6
DM=1000 between-trial relative S/N is ~99.9%

The above is for instrinsic pulse width of 40 us. Of course the loss
in S/N is (a bit) better if intrinsically (or scattered to) more than
this. But if the observed width is DM smearing dominated (as it will
be at high DM) then the above numbers are pretty good, e.g. for the
Parkes FRBs.

Some people seem to think that dmtol 1.25 means a 25% loss from one
trial to the next, or a 100*(1-1/sqrt(1.25)% loss, but clearly it is
not as bad as this. Even dmtol of 1.25 might be overkill, but it is
certainly very thorough!
