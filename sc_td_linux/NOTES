30/11/2011 SC_TD_NEW NOTES

Yesterday I did the following to get sc_td_new compiled on a linux
machine. It seems to work (i.e. it compiles and it seems to make dat
and hdr files) but I offer no guarantees whatsoever (I'm especially
iffy about all the quotey stuff I added to coord_str.f but it seems
alright). Use at your own risk.

1. Copied ORIGINAL_DIR here from dcore1:~reatough/sc_td.new/

2. Added the following to my .cshrc file
  setenv LOGIN_ARCH linux

3. Made a directory called include

4. Copied Makefile.extended, Makefile.install, Makefile.standard and
   Makefile.linux from
   dcore1:/raid1/software/pulsar/cvshome/pasurv/include/ to include/

5. Changed Makefiles ...

    Makefile:
      Changed:
      LOCAL_ROOT = ../../../ -> LOCAL_ROOT = .
      Commented out:
      LDFLAGS += -lgenutil

    include/Makefile.linux:
      Changed:
      CC = /raid1/software/gcc3.2.2/bin/gcc -> CC = gcc
      Changed:
      FC = /raid1/software/gcc3.2.2/bin/g77 -> FC = gfortran
      Commented out:
      LF77 = -L/raid1/software/pulsar/star/lib/
      Changed:
      CPPLIBS = -L/usr/lib/cmplrs/cxx -lcxxstd -lcxx -lexc -lc -L/raid1/software/pulsar/star/lib/ -> CPPLIBS = -L/usr/lib/cmplrs/cxx -lcxxstd -lcxx -lexc -lc

    include/Makefile.standard
      Changed:
      LARCHIVE = -larchive -ltempo++ -lpolyco -leph -lgenutil $(LFFT) $(LTIMES) -> LARCHIVE = -larchive -ltempo++ -lpolyco -leph $(LFFT) $(LTIMES) 

6. Changed some FORTRAN files ...

    st_inpar.f
      Commented out:
      external iargc
      Reason: 
      gfortran interprets the external differently to g77 so this needs to be removed. For details see e.g. http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/fortran/2007-01/msg00236.html

    sct_linux.f 
      Changed:
      ln=length(name) -> ln=len(name)
      Reason:
      length() doesn't seem to be a fortran function, but len() is. I assume this is also something which was ok in old fortran compilers but not in gfortran.

    coord_str.f
      Added:
      character(len=40) fmt
      Changed:
      write (string, '(a,i2.2, 2('':'', i2.2), ''.'', i<ndec>.
   -                  <ndec>)') sign, ihord, imin, isec, isecdec
      ->
      write(fmt,'(a,i2.2, 2('':'', i2.2), ''.'',"(I", I0, ")"
   - ".""(I", I0, ")")') ndec, ndec
      Added:
      write(string,fmt) sign, ihord, imin, isec, isecdec
      Reason:
      The <ndec> syntax is not part of GNU Fortran so when compiling with gfortran (as opposed to the ancient g77) the code must be changed to something standard like this. For details see, e.g. http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/Variable-FORMAT-expressions.html
