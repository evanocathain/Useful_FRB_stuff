This version of sc_td supports a direct killing of the bad channels,
on a tape by tape base. The related database is stored in the
file "kill.chans" pointed by the env variable "tapeinfo". This
must be set before running the program, and "kill.chans" imported
when downloading the code.
The automatic zapping can be disabled only using the option "-x" 
in the command line of sc_td.
