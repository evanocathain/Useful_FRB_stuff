A script which will grab the FRBs from the raw data files (provided on
Google Drive here:

NB This directory will be made public shortly)

Simply replace the directories where you have things and run:

csh script2.csh

You could then look at the pulses by doing (for example):

psrplot -p F -j "F 8, B 500" *.ar     [ with sweep ]
psrplot -p F -j "D, F 8, B 500" *.ar  [ sweep removed ]

OR if you prefer to make a custom gnuplot recipe try:

gnuplot
gnuplot> set palette gray negative
gnuplot> plot "<file>.cube" u 2:(-$1):3 with image

OR if you prefer to make a custom pgplot recipe

then I refuse to help you.
